                <h1>About Fashion</h1>
                <p class="aboutfashion">Fashion is a form of self-expression and autonomy at a particular period and
                    place and
                    in a specific context, of clothing, footwear, lifestyle, accessories, makeup, hairstyle, and body
                    posture.[1] The term implies a look defined by the fashion industry as that which is trending.
                    Everything
                    that is considered fashion is available and popularized by the fashion system (industry and media).

                    Due to increased mass-production of commodities and clothing at lower prices and global reach,
                    sustainability has become an urgent issue among politicians, brands, and consumers.[2][3]</p>

                <h1>2. Donna Karan </h1>
                <p class="p1">Donna Karan’s love of fashion was instilled in her at a young age, shaping her brand in a number of
                    ways. The renowned fashion designer launched Seven Easy Pieces with her first collection in 1984,
                    transforming the way women dressed and examined style. Donna Karan’s understanding of the needs and
                    desires of the modern woman is conveyed through every fabulous piece. The fashion visionary is the
                    sole creator of the DKNY label (Donna Karen New York), flourishing as an iconic creative mind and
                    designer throughout the past three decades.</p>

                <h1>3. Giorgio Armani</h1>
                <p class="p1">The outstanding Italian fashion designer, Giorgio Armani, is famous for the clean, tailored lines of
                    his menswear collections. He established Armani, the fashion powerhouse, in 1975. With the aid of
                    his success, he was acclaimed as the most successful Italian designer by 2001. “Successful” is an
                    understatement for Giorgio Armani as he has earned an annual turnover of $1.6 billion and a personal
                    fortune of $7 billion as of 2012. Armani is the first designer to ban models who had a Body Mass
                    Index under 18, revolutionizing the fashion industry and transforming how the industry perceives
                    body image. Giorgio Armani is truly a living legend.</p>
